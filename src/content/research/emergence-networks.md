## Overview

This research investigates the mechanisms by which complex behaviors emerge in networks of simple computational agents. By studying these systems, we can better understand both natural phenomena and design principles for artificial intelligence.

## Key Findings

- Network topology influences emergence patterns significantly
- Simple local rules generate complex global behaviors
- Information flow rates predict system stability
- Computational efficiency emerges naturally under certain conditions

## Methods

We employed agent-based modeling, network analysis, and information theory to analyze emergence in:
- Boolean networks
- Multi-agent systems
- Graph neural networks
- Biological neural systems

## Implications

This work suggests that emergence is not magical but rather a natural consequence of interconnected systems operating under simple rules. Understanding these principles helps us design better artificial systems and interpret natural ones.
